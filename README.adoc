== Getting started

rules_update is a repository rules , and therefore made to be used in the WORKSPACE.

First, tell bazel to load the rule and its dependencies with a load() statement.

include::docs/workspace.adoc[]

Next create the yaml rules defining the chnage you want to apply.

For updating `http_file` or `http_archive` rules inside the `WORKSPACE` file :

[source, yaml]
----
change_name:
  name: name_of_the_rule                                                    #required
  sha256: ef7ef66e05ec827c058df76eeb407bda148cf358809611417e537a1cf1bffcdb  #optional
  prefix: my_prefix                                                         #optional
  url: my_download_url                                                      #required

----

if you do not set the sha256, it will be filled in automatically based on the download URL.

WARNING: Do not forget to add an empty line at the end of the yaml file

For updating `constants` or `dictionary` assignments inside the nay bazel file :

[source, yaml]
----
change_name:
  name: name_of_the_assignments     #required
  key: xxx                          #required only if assignment is a dictionary
  value: my_value                   #required

----

WARNING: Do not forget to add an empty line at the end of the yaml file

Next in your BUILD files call the rule for updating the corresponding bazel files:

[source, python]
----
load("@rules-update//:update.bzl", "update_http", "update_version)

update_http(
    name = "update_workspace",
    yaml_files = ["my_yaml_file", "my_other_yaml_file"],
    bazel_file = "//:WORKSPACE",
)

update_version(
    name = "update_versions",
    yaml_files = ["my_version_yaml_file", "my_other_version_yaml_file"],
    bazel_file = "//:my_bazel_file.bzl",
)
----

Now just run
[source, shell]
----
bazel run //:update_workspace
bazel run //:update_versions
----
